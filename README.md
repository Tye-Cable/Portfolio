Hello, welcome to my portfolio. Thank you for stopping by to have look at my exhibition of skills and current projects I am working on. Feel free to contact me with any questions or provide any advice on my work. All feedback is greatly appreciated. If you would like to see my work experience, please stop by my [Linkedin Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/tyecable) or have a look at my [resume](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tc-personal18/TyeCableResume.pdf).

### Background

I received my Bachelor of Science in Information and Operations Management from Indiana University Southeast. After returning to school from a long break, I became increasingly interested in statistics. Since then, with each position I have held for employment, I have worked to use statistical analysis to recognize opportunities and help predict KPI’s. Because of my education and military background, I fall easily into operations roles and succeed.  However, I have stepped out of my operations role to revamp my resume and build my online portfolio to showcase my abilities. I will be relocating to the Tampa area soon and I am currently working to acquire a position that’s mutually beneficial for myself and employer in the data science space.
