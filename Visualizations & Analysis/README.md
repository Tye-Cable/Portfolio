### KeyWords File

This is a word cloud I constructed in R as I was job searching. I wanted to make sure that my resume included some of the keywords listed in job descriptions for data analyst. I copied and pasted 30 or so job descriptions from the most popular job boards into a text file and loaded it into R. From there it was just a matter of cleaning the data by adding an additional file of words I wanted to avoid in addition to the English stopwords. Some of the words I couldnâ€™t narrow down due to misspellings, but I think that I was able to gain some info from doing it. I was also looking for software experience requirements in which tableau, SQL, and excel showed up most often in the job descriptions.
